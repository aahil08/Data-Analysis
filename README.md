### SITUATION

The New Zealand Police Department wants to raise awareness about motor vehicle thefts. The Report analyzes data on stolen vehicles—focusing on when, what, and where vehicles tend to be stolen—and to provide insights for a public service announcement. This STAR report summarizes the objectives, methodology, analyses, visualizations, and recommendations derived from the dataset.

### Actions and Output Value

Drawing on a dataset of over 4,500 stolen vehicles, comprehensive analysis was conducted using MySQL and Excel. By filtering, sorting, and leveraging various Excel statistical functions, the data revealed patterns, trends, and attributes contributing to vehicle thefts. Bar charts, heat maps, scatter plots, and maps provided valuable visual insights, guiding the New Zealand Police Department in formulating an effective prevention campaign.
