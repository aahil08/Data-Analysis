# Data-Analysis Portfolio Introduction

As the field of Data Science and Analytics continues to grow and evolve, the variety of business challenges it can address is truly remarkable. Each project featured here tackles a unique business problem—whether real-world or simulated—and demonstrates how different analytical methods, from MySQL solutions to sophisticated AI and machine learning approaches, can drive meaningful results.

I invite you to explore each project, learn about the processes and techniques involved, and dive into the associated GitHub repositories by clicking on the titles below. Through these examples, you’ll see how I blend technical expertise with business understanding to transform raw data into actionable insights. Thank you for visiting, and I hope these projects inspire new ideas and possibilities in your own data-driven initiatives.

| **S**ituation | Motor-vehicle theft is rising nationwide. NZ Police needs decisive evidence to craft a high-impact public-service announcement (PSA) and optimise patrol resources. |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **T**ask      | Analyse *when* vehicles are stolen, *what* vehicles are most vulnerable, and *where* thefts cluster; translate findings into clear, actionable guidance for District Commanders and Prevention & Comms teams. |
| **A**ction    | Processed **58 642** police theft records (2020-24) in MySQL, cleaned 1.7 % nulls/dupes, and built Excel pivots and visuals (bar, heatmap,and scatterplots). Aggregations run via CTEs (`YEAR_AGG`, `MONTH_AGG`, `VEHICLE_TYPE_AGG`, `REGION_RATE`). |
| **R**esult    | Surfaced *season, location, and vehicle-specific* risk factors (e.g., +18 % Summer spike, Southland 5.2 thefts/1 000 cars). Outputs underpin the **“Summer Secure”** PSA, steering-lock subsidy bid, and density-aware patrol rosters. |
